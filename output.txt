Architecture and organization


Computer architecture deals with the design of computers, data storage devices, and networking components that store and run programs, transmit data, and drive interactions between computers, across networks, and with users.When an input or output instruction is encountered, the control unit transfers the data between the memory and the designated I/O controller.All of these components—the control unit, the ALU, the memory, and the I/O controllers—are realized with transistor circuits.Britannica Quiz

Computers host websites composed of HTML and send text messages as simple as...LOL.Computers also have another level of memory called a cache, a small, extremely fast (compared with the main memory, or random access memory [RAM]) unit that can be used to store information that is urgently or frequently needed.Current research includes cache design and algorithms that can predict what data is likely to be needed next and preload it into the cache for improved performance.I/O controllers connect the computer to specific input devices (such as keyboards and touch screen displays) for feeding information to the memory, and output devices (such as printers and displays) for transmitting information from the memory to users.Additional I/O controllers connect the computer to a network via ports that provide the conduit through which data flows when the computer is connected to the Internet.For instance, suppose that the instruction is a string of bits that is the code for LOAD 10.This instruction loads the contents of memory location 10 into the ALU.The next instruction, say ADD 15, is fetched.The control unit then loads the contents of memory location 15 into the ALU and adds it to the number already there.In general, programs are not just lengthy sequences of LOAD, STORE, and arithmetic operations.Most importantly, computer languages include conditional instructions—essentially, rules that say, “If memory location n satisfies condition a, do instruction number x next, otherwise do instruction y.” This allows the course of a program to be determined by the results of previous operations—a critically important ability.Finally, programs typically contain sequences of instructions that are repeated a number of times until a predetermined condition becomes true.For example, a loop would be needed to compute the sum of the first n integers, where n is a value stored in a separate memory location.Logic design is the area of computer science that deals with the design of electronic circuits using the fundamental principles and properties of logic (see Boolean algebra) to carry out the operations of the control unit, the ALU, the I/O controllers, and other hardware.For example, the addition circuit of the ALU has inputs corresponding to all the bits of the two numbers to be added and outputs corresponding to the bits of the sum.An important area related to architecture is the design of microprocessors, which are complete CPUs—control unit, ALU, and memory—on a single integrated circuit chip.Additional memory and I/O control circuitry are linked to this chip to form a complete computer.These thumbnail-sized devices contain millions of transistors that implement the processing and memory units of modern computers.VLSI microprocessor design occurs in a number of stages, which include creating the initial functional or behavioral specification, encoding this specification into a hardware description language, and breaking down the design into modules and generating sizes and shapes for the eventual chip components.Computer scientists are also involved in creating the computer-aided design (CAD) tools that support engineers in the various stages of chip design and in developing the necessary theoretical results, such as how to efficiently design a floor plan with near-minimal area that satisfies the given constraints.For example, in 1971 the first microprocessor chip (Intel Corporation’s 4004) had only 2,300 transistors, in 1993 Intel’s Pentium chip had more than 3 million transistors, and by 2000 the number of transistors on such a chip was about 50 million.The Power7 chip introduced in 2010 by IBM contained approximately 1 billion transistors.The phenomenon of the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubling about every two years is widely known as Moore’s law.If the systems are critical in that their failure would be potentially disastrous (as in aircraft control), incompatible outcomes collected from replicated processes running in parallel on separate machines are resolved by a voting mechanism.These disciplines include biology, chemistry, fluid dynamics, archaeology, finance, sociology, and forensics.The mathematical methods needed for computational science require the transformation of equations and functions from the continuous to the discrete.When discretized in this way, many problems can be recast as an equation involving a matrix (a rectangular array of numbers) solvable using linear algebra.Numerical analysis is the study of such computational methods.The requirements of big-data scientific problems, including the solution of ever larger systems of equations, engage the use of large and powerful arrays of processors (called multiprocessors or supercomputers) that allow many calculations to proceed in parallel by assigning them to separate processing elements.Graphics and visual computing


Graphics and visual computing is the field that deals with the display and control of images on a computer screen.This field encompasses the efficient implementation of four interrelated computational tasks: rendering, modeling, animation, and visualization.Graphics techniques incorporate principles of linear algebra, numerical integration, computational geometry, special-purpose hardware, file formats, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to accomplish these complex tasks.Fine arts applications allow artists to use the computer screen as a medium to create images, cinematographic special effects, animated cartoons, and television commercials.Medical imaging applications involve the visualization of data obtained from technologies such as X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) to assist doctors in diagnosing medical conditions.Scientific visualization uses massive amounts of data to define simulations of scientific phenomena, such as ocean modeling, to produce pictures that provide more insight into the phenomena than would tables of numbers.Graphics also provide realistic visualizations for video gaming, flight simulation, and other representations of reality or fantasy.The bright blue area indicates that the cancer spread to the occipital lobe (lower right).Edges must be smoothed and textured so that their underlying construction from polygons is not obvious to the naked eye.HCI occurs at an interface that includes both software and hardware.Because user interfaces must accommodate a variety of user styles and capabilities, HCI research draws on several disciplines including psychology, sociology, anthropology, and engineering.In the 1960s, user interfaces consisted of computer consoles that allowed an operator directly to type commands that could be executed immediately or at some future time.With the advent of more user-friendly personal computers in the 1980s, user interfaces became more sophisticated, so that the user could “point and click” to send a command to the operating system.
